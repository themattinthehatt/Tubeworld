======================== META TOWER =========================
Classes
	TowerBeam: unmodified
	TowerGirder: mostly unmodified; biggest change should be in addBeam method,
		which should now use a new basepoint variable and an orientation variable
		in order to translate the xyz coordinates of the logic array into the
		proper physical xyz coordinates	
		reset method should reset basepoint nad orientation
	MetaGirder: should be a relatively simple class that stores an array of 
		TowerGirder objects, an XYZ 
	MetaTower:
		properties:
			is_occupied_meta: logical array for MetaGirder locations
			num_beams_x
			num_beams_y
			MetaGirder height; width determined by size of base in TowerGirder
		methods: most of these will probably trickle down to equiv. methods in TowerGirder
			update
				-loop through and update MetaGirders
					-loop through and update TowerGirders
			reset
				-loop through and reset MetaGirder
					-loop through and reset TowerGirder 
			forceSynch (or something): when first TowerGirder hits a MetaNode, force all other
				girders in MetaTower to catch up so they can all update simulaneously; maybe
				just the girders within that particular MetaGirder? Probably looks better

Notes:
	skip dealing with nodes for now. just have open cubes
